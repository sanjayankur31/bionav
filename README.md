# bionav

Bionav is a ROS stack that aims to implement a bio-mimetic navigation system.

Currently, this source code includes an implementation of the path integrator dynamics of head direction cells and grid cells. It is far from a complete navigation solution.

## Publications
The source code was used in the following publications:

* Sinha, A. & Wang, J. – “An implementation of the path integrator mechanism of head direction cells for bio-mimetic navigation” – accepted and to be presented at IJCNN 2014, Beijing, China.
* Sinha, A. & Wang, J. – “Bio-mimetic path integration using a self organizing population of grid cells” – accepted and to be presented at ICANN 2014, Hamburg, Germany.
